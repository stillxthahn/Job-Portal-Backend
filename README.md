# Job portal backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for the Job Portal web application. The backend is built using the Serverless Framework to design and deploy a highly scalable and efficient serverless architecture leveraging AWS Services, including:

- **AWS Lambda**: For handling the core business logic and API requests.
- **Application Load Balancer**: To ensure high availability and efficient load distribution across services.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: For fast and flexible NoSQL database management.
  
This repository serves as the backend API, providing all necessary functionalities and endpoints required to power the Job Portal application.
